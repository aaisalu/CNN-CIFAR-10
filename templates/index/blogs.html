      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
        The classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. It is widely
        used for training and benchmarking machine learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm specifically designed for image recognition
        and processing. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of
        features from input images. This makes them highly effective for tasks like image classification, object
        detection, and more.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How CNN Works for CIFAR-10</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        The CNN architecture for CIFAR-10 typically consists of the following layers:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Takes 32x32 RGB images as input.</li>
        <li><strong>Convolutional Layers:</strong> Apply filters to extract features like edges, textures, and patterns.
          Multiple convolutional layers are stacked to capture increasingly complex features.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation Function (ReLU):</strong> Introduces non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn
          complex patterns. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is commonly used.</li>
        <li><strong>Pooling Layers:</strong> Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making the model
          computationally efficient and reducing overfitting. Max pooling is the most common technique.</li>
        <li><strong>Fully Connected Layers:</strong> Flatten the output from convolutional layers and connect every
          neuron to every other neuron in the next layer. These layers combine the features to make final predictions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Uses a softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each of the
          10 classes in CIFAR-10.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Key Components of CNN</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Filters/Kernels:</strong> Small matrices used to detect features like edges, corners, and textures.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stride:</strong> Determines the step size of the filter as it moves across the image.</li>
        <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Adds extra pixels around the input image to control the spatial size of the output
          feature maps.</li>
        <li><strong>Pooling:</strong> Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining important
          information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why CNN for CIFAR-10?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        CNNs are particularly well-suited for CIFAR-10 because:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li>They can automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, which is crucial for recognizing objects in
          images.</li>
        <li>They are computationally efficient due to weight sharing and pooling layers.</li>
        <li>They achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Challenges with CIFAR-10</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Despite its simplicity, CIFAR-10 poses challenges such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Small image size (32x32), which makes it harder to capture fine-grained details.</li>
        <li>High intra-class variability and inter-class similarity.</li>
        <li>Limited dataset size, which can lead to overfitting if not properly regularized.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        CNNs are a powerful tool for image classification tasks like CIFAR-10. By leveraging convolutional layers,
        pooling, and fully connected layers, CNNs can effectively learn and classify complex patterns in images. With
        proper tuning and regularization, CNNs can achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
